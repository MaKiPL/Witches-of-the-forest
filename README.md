# What's this?
I started this project as an playground. It was meant to render various glitch and horror effects, though instead I though that'd be great if I released this as an effects example. I rewrote it all and that's what I ended up- a MonoGame project with various special effects for rendering that you can easily put into your Draw() and Update() after some small changes

# What effects are available?
I'm currently active at rewriting code to add more modular effects. Currently available are:

 * Rain
 * Snow
 * Milky Way
 * Circle beat
 
# What effects to expect?
Whatever will come to my mind, however these are remaining to be rewritten:

  * Glitch/ dreamlike
  * Smoke
